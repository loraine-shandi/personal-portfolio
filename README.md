# Personal Portfolio

Hi! I'm a UI/UX beginner and an Information Systems student who loves learning and creating digital experiences. This website, built with React, shows a bit about me, my skills, and the projects Iâ€™ve worked on.


# Purpose


This portfolio is a personal yet professional space where I share my skills, projects, and achievements. It serves as an interactive resume and a showcase of my work, designed to be user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealingâ€”reflecting both my design style and technical skills.
